<p class="bodytexthighlight">
The television landscape has shifted. Gone are the days of crowding around the television and watching a show together as a family aside from the occasional &lsquo;event&rsquo; broadcast like BBC's <span class="bodytextem">The Bodyguard</span> or a national sporting event. Young people are watching television on individual devices - their phones, tablets or laptops. They might not even be watching live, with all the 'cord-cutters' opting to watch from various streaming video services, like <span class="bodytextem">Netflix</span> or <span class="bodytextem">Hulu</span>.<p>

<p class="bodytextnormal">
This shift in viewing patterns has left the industry scrambling to keep up - <span class="bodytextem">Ofcom</span>, the British regulatory body for media recently encouraged British broadcasters to work together to form a Netflix rival - <span class="bodytextem">Britflix</span>, anyone? Ofcom seems convinced that people will flock to a 'single destination' for content.</p>

<p class="bodytextnormal">
The examples mentioned previously are just some of the methods and strategies producers have been working within an attempt to keep viewers engaged, keep them coming back for more and keep them from getting distracted by the endless stream of original content these days.</p>

<p class="bodytextnormal">In just two decades, the number of households in the U.S. with at least one TV set rose from less than a million to 44 million. That number today is 115 million. The issue isn't that the audience isn't there - it's how to engage and captivate an audience enough to gather together and watch something as a collective. </p>


<img id="xfiles" src="img/xfiles.png" alt="Logo Row" height="10%;">

<p class="bodytextnormal">The one seemingly obvious answer is to harness the power of the 'fandom' with shows like <span class="bodytextem">The X-Files</span> and <span class="bodytextem">Supernatural</span> using this in recent years. In Season 10 of The X-Files, the end-credits featured various fan handles from social media. Supernatural had several episodes dedicated to the fandom, including a musical.</p>

<p class="bodytextnormal">Another method to increase viewership is to hook a viewer in with interactivity, but even today this is limited by technology's general clunkiness. We've never quite moved on from the problems faced by <span class="bodytextem">Mr Winky Dink and Woofer</span>, with kids drawing directly on screens. People generally don't like learning new technologies or trying things outside of their comfort zone.</p>

<p class="bodytextnormal">Transmedia and ever-growing expanded universes will continue to exist and be successful, but sometimes struggle when they get too large. One example of this is Marvel's Cinematic Universe recently reaching a stumbling block when faced with the surprise cancellation of Netflix's <span class="bodytextem">Luke Cage</span>, <span class="bodytextem">Iron Fist</span> and <span class="bodytextem">Daredevil</span>. </p>

<p class="bodytextnormal">So what then is the solution? I would hazard a guess that it's a combination of all three. I don't think one solution will fit all for any audience. Much like the 1950s era of television development, it's going to increasingly be a period of trial and error, with bold producers trying novel new concepts and hoping they don't crash and burn.</p>

<p class="bodytextnormal">In the end, television will become increasingly personalised. Being presented with deep-learning powered suggestions for content I want to watch combined with ads that I want to see, that's the future that we're heading towards. It's time for broadcast television to catch up with Netflix - whether that's through a rival like 'Britflix' or something new altogether, television is here to stay. </p>
