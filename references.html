<span class="referencetitle">Barnett, K, 2017. It's Only Teenage Wasteland: The Home Media Revival of Freaks and Geeks. Cult Media.</span>

This is an article from the academic journal 'Cult Media.' It deals extensively with the fan campaign surrounding the cancellation of the show 'Freaks and Geeks' and how it went from an obscure 'teen TV show' to a home-media hit. This will definitely be something worth exploring in my section on 'save our shows' since the show was only produced on DVD after a commitment from fans to purchase it in large volumes, this is yet another example of media companies acknowledging fans wishes and so is a useful illustration of my point.

Whether or not I tackle a Freaks and Geeks section in detail, this article has some informative statistics and quotes that make for interesting research.</p>

Chris Crawford, originally a game designer, creating the game 'Eastern Front (1941)' for the Atari console. In 1982, he retired from game designing full time to develop solutions for 'next-generation storytelling' this decade's long research concluded in his 2012 self-titled 'Chris Crawford on Interactive Storytelling.'

The book deals extensively with various aspects of interactive storytelling, including the many challenges that developers face with creating such platforms like "the challenge between user agency and authorial control."

This book tackles many aspects of my essay into really fascinating sections and many pros & cons, including the conclusion that true interactive storytelling may not come to pass for many more decades. </p>

<span class="referencetitle">Guynes, S., 2018. Star Wars and the History of Transmedia Storytelling. 1st ed. Amsterdam University Press.</span>

This book by Sean Guynes is a collection of essays from various academic professionals looking at Star Wars' various transmedia attempts - including the original Expanded Universe and the more recent new Star Wars canon. This book provides a gluttony of quotes and interesting facts that will greatly benefit my discussion of a transmedia narrative as a general concept. Star Wars obviously isn't television - but it is still a serialised narrative and it's status as a cultural behemoth makes it ripe for exploration in this section of my essay.

Another interesting section the book covers is the idea of 'Fandom Edits' - groups of fans coming together to 're-edit' a released film or television series to make it more to their liking, like the 'Phantom Cut', all 3 Star Wars prequels edited into one standalone film with considerably less Jar Jar. </p>

<span class="referencetitle">McErlean, K., 2018. Interactive Narratives and Transmedia Storytelling. 1st ed. Routledge.</span>

This book, by Northern Irish author Kathy McErlean, discusses the new 'storytelling paradigm' of Interactive Narratives that can be explored and manipulated by the user. She goes on to discuss the likes of Steven Soderbergh's Mosaic and how despite it being released in two forms - one an interactive app experience and one a 'typical' TV narrative, Soderbergh insisted that the app experience is the only way it should be viewed.

In her conclusion, she talks about the future and how she thinks VR and AR will play a role, but we're not there yet. In the meantime, interactive storytelling experiences will continue to increase in significance, especially as big players like Netflix and HBO wade into the waters.

I believe her book will be a great utility for my essay, particularly my Transmedia section and my Interactive Narrative section, her well-informed case studies and array of statistical data is great for referencing and her book, in general, is informative and interesting and my reading of it so far has given me several new perspectives on my own ideas on the subject. </p>

This research paper examines the growth and success of SKAM - A hit Norwegian show - and how it went from a small local television project - with no advertising budget, to a huge international success. 

It also takes a deep dive into how technology and Skam's unique transmedia real-time narrative played a key role in this success. 

This paper will prove useful for my Transmedia section since Skam will be a large case study for me. The discussion around how it was the growing collection of fans - largely on Twitter and Tumblr and how they were the ones who made it accessible globally - the Norwegian channel NRK did not release the show with international subtitles - these were entirely fan created. This is next level fan engagement and is a perfect example of how this is constantly evolving with our times.</p>

This is a complimentary piece for me again, about Skam - however, this is a deep dive into the use of social media to expand on the narrative - like the 'Happy Birthday Isak' video 'created' by the character of Even in the season 4 finale. This video has received over 1 million views - the same episode of SKAM on NRK received only 531,000 viewers. 

The narrative expansion with characters posting Instagram posts during the show's hiatus - of them at school or at a party - it allowed the show to continue living despite not being on air - fans were still engaged and still actively discussing and theorising the show.

</span>

This article discusses how Star Trek's untimely cancellation in 1968 led to the show being catapulted into relevancy - driven entirely by a small collectable of fan's passion and excitement. 

Star Trek is one of the earliest (and arguably most successful of the period ) examples of a grassroots 'save our show' campaigns - this pre-dated the internet, so fans wrote to each other in the mail, taking out advertisements in newspapers and starting local meet-ups - all with the intention to bring Star Trek back for a season 3. They sent over 110,000 letters to NBC - who eventually reversed their cancellation decision

This is a fascinating read of fan engagement pre-dating social networking and the internet considerably. What's interesting is how this has evolved and continued to evolve - now TV fans 'tweet' at TV networks, which is I suppose the modern version of writing them mail.
